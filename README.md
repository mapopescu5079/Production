# Production

This JavaFX project allows users to add created products into a database for production. <br />
Once products have been created by the user they are entered into a production log available<br />
 to the user. This was an individual project in which I received occasional help and <br />
guidance from the instructor or student assistants. I created this project as an assignment<br />
 during the first semester of my junior year at Florida Gulf Coase University. Through it <br />
and other courses this semester, my knowledge and proficiency has greatly increased.

## Documentation

Create a docs folder in your project. If using Java, generate JavaDoc in your IDE. If using C++, use Doxygen. Change repository settings (using Settings at top of page) to use GitHub Pages with your docs folder. Add a link to the javadoc/doxygen index.html file with this markdown: \[Text to appear]\(URL) <br />
The URL will be mapopescu5079.github.io/Production/foldername/filename<br /> 
Do not include the docs folder name in your URL. <br />
Sample: \[JavaDoc]\(https://pv-cop.github.io/PV-README-TEMPLATE/javadoc/index.html) <br /> <br />
[JavaDoc](https://pv-cop.github.io/PV-README-TEMPLATE/javadoc/index.html)
