# Production

This JavaFX project allows users to add created products into a database for production. Once products have been created by the user <br />
they are entered into a production log available to the user. This was an individual project in which I received occasional help and <br />
guidance from the instructor or student assistants. I created this project as an assignment during the first semester of my junior year <br />
at Florida Gulf Coase University. Through it and other courses this semester, my knowledge and proficiency has greatly increased.
